same should be for largest folders I think
edesigned Category Breakdown card to two-column layout:
Left: Smaller pie chart + clickable category legend
Right: Scrollable DataGrid showing files in selected category


treemap is just a giant blob with nothing to click through


dark mode still has white on it it should be all black and green/red and maybe some ligheter black/dark grey for some segments 


filteres for largest file is going by the number not but hte value like 9gb is showing bigger than 30gb



game installations are showing duplicats

text is black in dark mode in some places
