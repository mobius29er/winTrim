dark mode still has white on it it should be all black and green/red and maybe some ligheter black/dark grey for some segments 
game installations are showing duplicats

text is black in dark mode in some places

what other blue ocean features can we add?

see screenshots folder for examples

all foldeers should have the ability to open to the file location

quickclean should provide a preview and toggle selection to confrim before deleting anyything
File Exploerer is a mess can't see where the file/folder loaction is filteers/sorters aren't reallyy functioning in a wayy that makes sense
Blue Ocean Features
Ideas Ranked by Value/Effort:

Feature	Value	Effort	Recommendation
Duplicate file finder	High	High	⏸️ Phase 2
File age heatmap	Medium	Medium	🤔 Consider
Growth tracking	Medium	High	⏸️ Later
Quick actions (delete temp)	High	Low	✅ Good candidate
Export improvements	Medium	Low	✅ Quick win

for largest folders instead of having a bar chart we shouldhave the chart behind the folder name and just have a larger box that wayy with the color a bit =transparaeent to be able to read the text easily
Phase 2 (Medium Effort):
4. Quick Clean preview with checkboxes
5. File Explorer improvements

not differentiating between mb and gb so 800mb is showing as larger than 90gb
we need filter and sort options and ability to open folders from the file explorer tab section
folder aren't opening when clicking on it in the Largest Folders Card/sectiono
cleanup suggestion is still missing the abilityy to expand/collapse use the same like the quick clean please
