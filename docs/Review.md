The chart for Largest Folders isn't legible and looks messy instead of a seperate chart have the bar graph appear behind the name with a transperany to it in the actual list so users can see that way
Treemap still isn't funcitoning i click on it and nothing happens it doesn't go down a level or anything
Folder structure should have the option to open to file location for the usere to delete/address as needed
all throughout the app users should be able to right click and copyy the file path an dnames of different items
OVerview tab is cutting off some cards and isn't responsive to different window sizes. should maybe add a scroll feature or maybe som esort of vertical layout when it gets too narrow and horizontal it should go to a horiztonal layout
